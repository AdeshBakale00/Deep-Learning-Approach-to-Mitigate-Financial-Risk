# Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Mitigate-Financial-Risk
This project uses deep learning to predict stock prices by analyzing historical data with an LSTM model. We stored and retrieved stock data from a MySQL database, then forecasted prices for the next month. The results are displayed through an interactive Streamlit chart with risk metrics, and additional insights are visualized using Power BI.
